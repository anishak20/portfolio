Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2.

This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

Somorendro Singh (Professor, Dept. of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi)\nIn this study, I conducted an in depth literature review of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) focusing on the quark-gluon plasma phase and the MIT Bag Model. I implemented the paper and investigated the Equation of State (EoS) of strange quark matter using the Density Dependent Quark Mass (DDQM) model, an extension of the MIT Bag Model, to better understand the internal structure of neutron stars.\nDensity-Dependent Quark Mass Model Quark matter in the cores of neutron stars is expected to exist in the form of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It is referred as strange quark matter (SQM). The quark masses are parametrized as functions of the baryon density as mentioned in Anand et al., 2000:\nThe system is in the presence of a magnetic field B which is directed along the z-axis. The energy of the charged particle of mass m and charge q in the presence of B is given by:\nThe expression for the thermodynamic potential follows Anand et al., 2000:\nwhere the second term is due to the contribution from gluons.\nStandard thermodynamic relations yield the expressions for pressure, energy density, entropy, and specific heat:\nHence, these are numerically computed for a range of temperatures at chemical potential = 300 MeV:\nThe nature of the graphs indicates a continuous, smooth second-order phase transition of the matter. Furthermore, the speed of sound was computed and compared with both lattice and curvature data, showing consistency at higher temperatures. This indicates that at sufficiently high densities and temperatures, neutron star matter may deconfine into a soup of quark-gluon plasma.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/thesis/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eProf. S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

It computes similarity as a function of time lag between the two curves, and the peak of the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) gives the optimal lag value. It was implemented using scipy.signal.correlate() from SciPy library in Python.\nData Files Data File\rDescription\rUsage\r.fit\nglg_tte_n7_bn240825662_v00.fit\rTime-Tagged Event data from NaI detector N7\rExtract photon arrival times and PHA channels\r.pha\nglg_cspec_n7_bn240825662_v00.pha\rBinned count spectrum with energy boundaries\rIdentify energy channels corresponding to 8–50 keV\r.rsp2\nglg_cspec_n7_bn240825662_v04.rsp2\rInstrument response matrix\rMap channels to energy and filter 8–50 keV photons\rResults Light Curves GRB240825A (T90 = 3.968 ± 0.091 s) Energy bands:\nLow: 8–50 keV Medium: 50–300 keV High: 300–1000 keV Estimated Spectral Lag (from CCF) Energy Bands (keV)\rSpectral Lag\r8–50 vs 50–300\r–64 ms\r50–300 vs 300–1000\r–64 ms\r8–50 vs 300–1000\r–128 ms\rError Estimation (Gaussian Fit) Energy Bands (keV)\rSpectral Lag (Peak CCF)\rSpectral Lag (Gaussian Fit)\r8–50 vs 50–300\r–64 ms\r–299 ± 8 ms\r8–50 vs 300–1000\r–128 ms\r–334 ± 9 ms\rDiscussion A negative spectral lag was observed for GRB 240825A. Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

It computes similarity as a function of time lag between the two curves, and the peak of the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) gives the optimal lag value. It was implemented using scipy.signal.correlate() from SciPy library in Python.\nData Files Data File\rDescription\rUsage\r.fit\nglg_tte_n7_bn240825662_v00.fit\rTime-Tagged Event data from NaI detector N7\rExtract photon arrival times and PHA channels\r.pha\nglg_cspec_n7_bn240825662_v00.pha\rBinned count spectrum with energy boundaries\rIdentify energy channels corresponding to 8–50 keV\r.rsp2\nglg_cspec_n7_bn240825662_v04.rsp2\rInstrument response matrix\rMap channels to energy and filter 8–50 keV photons\rResults Light Curves GRB240825A (T90 = 3.968 ± 0.091 s) Energy bands:\nLow: 8–50 keV Medium: 50–300 keV High: 300–1000 keV Estimated Spectral Lag (from CCF) Energy Bands (keV)\rSpectral Lag\r8–50 vs 50–300\r–64 ms\r50–300 vs 300–1000\r–64 ms\r8–50 vs 300–1000\r–128 ms\rError Estimation (Gaussian Fit) Energy Bands (keV)\rSpectral Lag (Peak CCF)\rSpectral Lag (Gaussian Fit)\r8–50 vs 50–300\r–64 ms\r–299 ± 8 ms\r8–50 vs 300–1000\r–128 ms\r–334 ± 9 ms\rDiscussion A negative spectral lag was observed for GRB 240825A. Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.

Paulino Afonso (Researcher, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal)\nThis project was undertaken as part of a summer research internship at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço (IAstro) , Portugal. During this internship, I have simulated and applied the transformation effects: Cosmological dimming, scaling and modelling of luminosity evolution to the host galaxy SN2005hc at three different values of redshift using the artificial redshifting algorithm (FERENGI). The main project aim was to investigate the observational biases that influence the estimation of physical parameters such as Star Formation Rate, Stellar Mass in galaxies.\nWhy do we need to examine the biases? The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that galaxies tend to appear increasingly irregular at higher redshifts. However, to make meaningful comparisons between galaxy populations across different cosmic epochs, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to account for various observational limitations. These include selection and instrumental biases as well as cosmological effects. For example, the surface brightness dimming effect impacts the flux of the galaxy by two orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=2. This strongly effects the galaxy morphological studies.\nNearly 10,000 galaxies captured in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing 13 billion years of cosmic history. Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI \u0026 HUDF Team\rData Source The data used is acquired from the amusing survey which focuses on the galaxies hosting type 1a supernovae. Instrument used is MUSE on the VLT. The target for our study is SN2005hc host galaxy. The data here is in the form of FITS file which consists of 3d data cube containing both spatial and spectral information.\nMethodology The artificial redshifting algorithm implemented follows the FERENGI approach to simulate how nearby galaxies would appear at higher redshifts as described in the paper by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2022:\nStep 1: Redshift Selection Selected target redshifts: z = 0.3, 0.8, and 1.3\nStep 2: Transformations Applied Three major transformations were performed:\nCosmological Dimming Applied a flux dimming factor proportional to:\nSpatial Scaling Used the FREBIN 2D algorithm to resample each 2D wavelength slice, scaling to match the pixel scale at higher redshift. This preserves both:\nPhysical size (via angular diameter distance) Total flux (via luminosity distance) Luminosity Evolution Applied an evolution factor to account for the average evolution in brightness across different redshifts. This effect also accounts for the reduced observed flux due to increasing distance and redshift as outlined by A. Paulino-Afonso et al., 2016.\nResults The above images illustrate how galaxy appearance changes with increasing redshift. As redshift increases, in the cosmological dimming effect we observe a reduction in flux, especially in the outer regions of galaxies. While the scaling effect shows no apparent flux loss, the intrinsic luminosity evolution shows the change in intrinsic brightness of galaxies. Combining these effects, the images show galaxies appearing smaller and dimmer at higher redshifts, with noticeable flux loss from their outskirts.\rComparing with the spectral graph at z = 0, we observe that from z = 0.3 to z = 1.3, the dimming effect reduces the observed flux by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, under the scaling effect, the flux appears to be preserved across different redshifts at longer wavelengths. This suggests that as we move to higher redshift values, the flux of galaxies can be recovered to its intrinsic value. In the case of luminosity evolution, flux increases with redshift due to changes in the intrinsic brightness of galaxies. When combined, these effects result in a slight increase in observed flux, explained by the overlap between luminosity evolution and cosmological dimming.\rView my Jupyter Notebook for the full implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/iastro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAna S.

I extracted the CKM matrix element V₍ub₎, the shape parameter α, the form factor normalization f₊(0), and their associated uncertainties using non-linear least squares optimization method. The methodology and approach were adapted from the paper 1 and paper 2.\nIntroduction The B meson is a bound state consisting of a bottom (b) quark and either an up or down quark. It is an unstable, heavy meson that decays via the weak interaction, making it a valuable probe for studying flavor physics and the elements of the CKM matrix.\nOur interest lies in charged current interactions (weak interactions), which have their flavor structure encoded in the CKM matrix. The matrix describes the quark flavor-changing transitions in the standard model.\nVij matrix connects an up-type quark of the i-th generation to down-type quark of the j-th generation.\nV_CKM matrix is unitary,\nUnitarity violation can act as evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. However, the Standard Model does not predict specific values for these elements—they must be determined experimentally. Of all the CKM parameters, |V_ub| is one of the least precisely known, and its accurate extraction helps in testing the consistency of the Standard Model.\nWhy V_ub ? The element V_ub connects an up-type quark to a bottom-type quark. It has the largest error amongst all the unitarity triangle parameters.\nWhere to look for it? Here, we can see that the value of V_ub from BaBar and Belle experiments are not consistent with each other. This implies that the value is not conclusive. Hence, it seems that the best suited decay to study V_ub is instead semileptonic B meson decay B0→π-l+νl.\nMethodology Form factor models Model 1: Single pole/ resonance The most simple parametrization is the single pole/resonance parametrization of the form factor which describes the production of B* meson. In the figure, we can observe the semi leptonic decay of B meson. Here, B* meson is an intermediate particle. When B meson decays into a pion, the intermediate B* meson decays into a W boson and a lepton pair. Now for testing this model we extracted the value of Vub= 4.62 x 10^(-3) using BR equation by substituting the following inputs,\nHowever, if we go deeper we can analyze not only the BR but also consider the theoretical expression for decay distribution alongside the experimental data. The theoretical expression is given as,\nwhere dB/dq2 represents decay distribution and q2 represents energy of lepton pair,\rFor analysis, we have used the decay distribution experimental data from Babar and Belle experiments. Then we have fitted the Model 1 with the extracted value of Vub to the experimental data.\nWe can observe that Model 1 does not fit the data points accurately. This implies that the single pole model is a poor description. This observation highlights the necessity of introducing a new model to better fit the data points to obtain a more optimal value of Vub.\rModel 2: multi-pole model In order to improve the description we have proposed the multi-pole model. Here in the expression we have introduced 𝛼 which is an unknown parameter which gives the position of the second effective pole. Now, we have fitted the Model 2 to the data and extracted the value of 𝛼 and V_ub by using χ² minimzation method. The χ² function to be minimized in our fit is defined as,\nThe extracted value of V_ub and 𝛼 are:\nThe experimental data fits better with the dipole model. The χ² test was performed to quantify how well a model represents the experimental data. The null and alternative hypothesis were defined as,\rH0: The experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model. Ha: The experimental data deviates from the expected behavior of the fitted model. The obtained results are:\nχ² value: 10.57 , Degrees of freedom: 11\t, P-value: 0.48 Thus, the experimental data follows the expected behavior of the fitted model.\nIn the earlier analysis, the data points were assumed to be statistically independent. We now incorporate the correlations among the data points, which is essential for a more robust and realistic treatment of the uncertainties.\nCovariance Matrix A Covariance Matrix is a type of matrix used to describe the covariance values between two items in a random vector. It is also known as the variance-covariance matrix because the variance of each element is represented along the matrix’s major diagonal and the covariance is represented among the non-diagonal elements.\nIt helps us to identify the direction of the relationship(positive or negative) between variables. Covariance matrix are also essential to understand the high- dimensional datasets.\nThe general form of the covariance matrix is given as:\nPreviously we were fitting the Model 2 to the data using the χ² function defined as:\nUsing the curve fitting method, we can extract the covariance matrix, where the square roots of the diagonal elements provide the uncertainties associated with |V_ub| and α.\nOptimal |V_ub| = 0.0036673564708459404 Δ|V_ub| = 6.472941091232315e-05 Optimal α = 0.5525955917130655 Δα = 0.027348302682970248\nCovariance matrix: [[ 4.18989664e-09 -1.42442466e-06] [-1.42442466e-06 7.47929660e-04]] Now suppose that we have the covariance matrix for the experimental data points (dB/dq2), then our χ² function will be defined as,\nNow we can fit the Model 2 to the data using this χ² function to extract the values of V_ub and 𝛼.\nOptimal |V_ub|: 0.0036425765825239187 Optimal α: 0.5517995594632777 Minimum χ²: 0.10357435421646363 If we want to extract f_+(0) (normalization factor), and we have data from Lattice QCD simulations for form factor, then the χ² function will be defined as,\nThe extracted values are:\nMinimum chi² : 0.0009813578763637797 Optimal f_plus0: 0.2916072589130864 Optimal alpha : 0.43369605256977545 Delta f_plus0 : 0.015774043436603775 Delta alpha : 0.03757979960772628 Covariance matrix of parameters: [[ 0.00024882 -0.00056022] [-0.00056022 0.00141224]] Conclusion Semileptonic B-meson decays are an effective way to obtain accurate values for V_ub. The standard model only provides the structure of the transitions but does not predict specific values for parameters. The fitted model with the aforementioned values adequately represents the behavior of the experimental data gathered.\nHowever, the resulting values, though statistically meaningful, are not absolute and are subject to uncertainties arising from both experimental and theoretical inputs.\nProject Report\rView my Github Repository for the full details and implementation of the work.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/reyes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupervisor:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1247615\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Serra Húnter Fellow, Institut de Ciències del Cosmos, Universitat de Barcelona previously associated with Los Alamos National Lab, USA)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out during and post \u003ca href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREYES 2023\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

In this project, I constructed light curves of GRB 240825A from the FERMI GBM detector data and performed a cross-correlation analysis between two energy bands to estimate time delays between low and high-energy photon arrivals.\nWhat are Gamma-ray Bursts? Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transients in the universe. They can last from just a few milliseconds to several minutes and are observed at cosmological distances, with redshifts ranging from as low as 0.008 up to as high as 9.4. Their isotropic luminosities are exceptionally high — spanning from 10^47 to 10^54 erg/s. For comparison, the luminosity of the Sun is about 10^33 erg/s.\nCredit: A Roquette/ESO/CC BY-SA\rGRBs emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to TeV gamma rays. There are two main types of GRBs: long and short.\nLong-duration GRBs are generally believed to originate from collapsars — the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life. Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, are thought to result from the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Prompt Emission and Afterglow: Two Powerful Phases of GRBs GRBs are short-lived but extremely energetic events, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few days. They are generally divided into two distinct phases: the prompt emission and the afterglow.\nPrompt Emission Phase The prompt emission is the initial phase of a GRB and lasts only a few seconds.\nIt originates from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection occurring within the fast-moving jet launched by the central source. This phase takes place within the ejected material, before it has interacted with the surrounding environment. The emission is dominated by gamma rays, making it extremely bright and detectable even from cosmological distances. Afterglow Phase The afterglow follows the prompt emission and can last for hours to several days.\nIt is caused by external shocks that form when the jet interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This phase occurs in the shocked external environment, where the jet loses energy to the medium. The emission spans a wide range of wavelengths, including X-rays, optical, infrared, and radio, and gradually fades over time. The Fermi Instrument The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope carries two main instruments:\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): Covers 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. It has 14 detectors—12 NaI detectors (8 keV to 1 MeV) and 2 BGO detectors (200 keV to 40 MeV). Large Area Telescope (LAT): Detects higher-energy photons in the range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV. These instruments records the arrival time and energy of individual photons emitted by distant GRBs. Although all photons travel at the speed of light, they are emitted at slightly different times due to the internal dynamics of the burst. This timing difference is what we refer to as spectral lag.\nWhat is Spectral Lag ? Spectral lag refers to the time delay between the arrival of high-energy photons and low-energy photons during a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). It is one of the key temporal features observed in GRB light curves and is typically measured in milliseconds.\nSpectral lag plays a significant role in:\nUnderstanding emission mechanisms involved in GRBs. Estimating GRB redshifts indirectly, especially when direct measurements are unavailable. Interpretation of Spectral Lag Spectral lag is observed in two primary forms, each providing insights into the emission mechanisms and internal dynamics of GRBs.\nPositive Spectral Lag In a positive lag, high-energy photons are detected earlier than low-energy photons. This can be explained by synchrotron cooling, where high-energy photons are emitted first. As the electrons lose energy over time, they emit lower-energy photons, resulting in a delayed arrival of the latter. Negative Spectral Lag In a negative lag, low-energy photons are detected before high-energy photons. This can be attributed to inverse Compton up-scattering, where soft (low-energy) photons are boosted to higher energies by interactions with hot electron clouds in the jet. These upscattered high-energy photons are emitted later, causing the observed delay.

It computes similarity as a function of time lag between the two curves, and the peak of the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) gives the optimal lag value. It was implemented using scipy.signal.correlate() from SciPy library in Python.\nData Files Data File\rDescription\rUsage\r.fit\nglg_tte_n7_bn240825662_v00.fit\rTime-Tagged Event data from NaI detector N7\rExtract photon arrival times and PHA channels\r.pha\nglg_cspec_n7_bn240825662_v00.pha\rBinned count spectrum with energy boundaries\rIdentify energy channels corresponding to 8–50 keV\r.rsp2\nglg_cspec_n7_bn240825662_v04.rsp2\rInstrument response matrix\rMap channels to energy and filter 8–50 keV photons\rResults Light Curves GRB240825A (T90 = 3.968 ± 0.091 s) Energy bands:\nLow: 8–50 keV Medium: 50–300 keV High: 300–1000 keV Estimated Spectral Lag (from CCF) Energy Bands (keV)\rSpectral Lag\r8–50 vs 50–300\r–64 ms\r50–300 vs 300–1000\r–64 ms\r8–50 vs 300–1000\r–128 ms\rError Estimation (Gaussian Fit) Energy Bands (keV)\rSpectral Lag (Peak CCF)\rSpectral Lag (Gaussian Fit)\r8–50 vs 50–300\r–64 ms\r–299 ± 8 ms\r8–50 vs 300–1000\r–128 ms\r–334 ± 9 ms\rDiscussion A negative spectral lag was observed for GRB 240825A. Negative spectral lag in GRBs, though rare, can arise from inverse Compton up-scattering of soft photons by a surrounding hot electron medium. A notable difference exists between the spectral lag values obtained from the peak of the CCF and from Gaussian fitting. This discrepancy suggests that the CCF may follow a Lorentzian profile rather than a Gaussian one.\nTo address this, I’m currently working on fitting a Lorentzian function to the CCF, which I believe may yield a more accurate estimate of the lag. Further improvements and analysis are ongoing to refine the results.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/grbs/","summary":"\u003c!-- ### 🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q553uslYW3Ho6P1G46SOEDxOS_VmHXfJ) --\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuide :\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eKhushboo Sharma\u003c/strong\u003e (Ph.D. student at ARIES, Nainital, India)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was carried out as part of the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences (\u003ca href=\"https://www.aries.res.in/ATSOAA-2025\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eATSOAA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) held in Nainital, India.

The simulation is performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\nIsing Model The Ising model is a theoretical model in statistical physics originally developed to describe ferromagnetism. It models a system of magnetic particles arranged either as a 1D chain or a 2D lattice, with one atom or molecule located at each lattice site i.\rEach molecule or atom is assigned a magnetic moment, represented in the model by a discrete variable called a spin, denoted si, which can take on values of \u0026plusmn;1. The two possible values indicate whether two spins si and sj are:\rParallel (aligned): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = +1\rAntiparallel (opposed): \u0026nbsp; si \u0026middot; sj = −1\rA system of two spins is considered to be in a lower-energy state when the magnetic moments are aligned. If the magnetic moments point in opposite directions, the system is in a higher-energy state. As a result, the system tends to align all magnetic moments in the same direction to minimize its total energy. When most of the spins are aligned, the collection of atoms behaves like a macroscopic magnet.\rA phase transition in the context of the Ising model refers to the transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Above the critical temperature (Tc), a ferromagnet is in a disordered phase, which corresponds to a random distribution of spin values. Below Tc, the system becomes ordered — nearly all spins align, even in the absence of an external magnetic field H.\rWhen a cooled ferromagnet is heated back up, the net magnetization vanishes at Tc and the system transitions from the ordered to the disordered phase. This behavior characterizes a second-order phase transition, where magnetization vanishes continuously.\r2D Ising Model We consider a 2-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising Model with:\rN2 = total number of sites on the lattice\r\u0026sigma;k \u0026isin; {+1, -1} = individual spin site on the lattice\rThe Hamiltonian is:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; Jij \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j - \u0026sum;i hi \u0026sigma;i\rwhere Jij is the interaction strength and hi is the external local magnetic field.\rIn this system, a particular configuration \u0026sigma; has the following probability:\rP(\u0026sigma;) = (1/Z) \u0026times; e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\rwhere\rZ = \u0026sum;{\u0026sigma;} e-\u0026beta;H(\u0026sigma;)\ris the partition function with \u0026beta; = 1/(kBT), and the sum is over all possible spin configurations of the system.\rFor h = 0, if the number of dimensions is larger than one, the Ising model exhibits a second-order phase transition.\rBelow a certain critical temperature, spontaneous magnetization occurs.\rFor d = 2, the transition temperature was calculated analytically by Onsager:\rTC = 2 / ln(1 + √2)\rIn our simulation, for simplicity, we choose a uniform ferromagnetic medium (i.e., Jij = J = 1) and no external field (i.e., hi = h = 0). We also fix the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.\rWith these assumptions, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\rH(\u0026sigma;) = - \u0026sum;\u0026lt;ij\u0026gt; \u0026sigma;i \u0026sigma;j\rFinally, we apply periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that all spins have the same number of neighbours.\rWe start with a random configuration,\rMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm The main steps for the implementation of Metropolis algorithm are:\nPrepare an initial configuration of N spins Flip the spin of a randomly chosen lattice site. Calculate the change in energy dE. If dE \u0026lt; 0, accept the move. Otherwise accept the move with probability exp^{-dE/T}. This satisfies the detailed balance condition, ensuring a final equilibrium state. Repeat steps 2-4. Snapshots of the configuration We start with a random initial condition and then plot the instantaneous configurations, as the system coarsens to its equilibrium state.\nTime evolution of the 2D Ising model at low temperature, illustrating domain coarsening. The simulation begins with a random configuration of spins (red = +1, blue = −1) at time 𝑡=0. As time progresses, energetically favorable spin alignments form and grow. By 𝑡=1000, the system reaches near-complete magnetic order, with spins predominantly aligned, indicating a transition to a ferromagnetic phase.\nAnalysis We now proceed with the analysis of the behaviour of the different observables as functions of the temperature T and of the size of the system N.
